A young girl, LUCY, enters the house. She is wearing a backpack and carrying a flashlight.

This is it. This is the house Grandpa told me about.

Lucy starts to look around the house. She finds old furniture, dust and cobwebs everywhere.

I found it! The key!

"My dear Lucy, I'm sorry I couldn't be there for you. I've always loved you and I hope you find this key. It will lead you to something very special. Love, Grandpa."
